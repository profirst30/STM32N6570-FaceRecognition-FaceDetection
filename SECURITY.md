# Security and Privacy Policy

## Security Overview

The STM32N6 Face Recognition System processes biometric data and requires careful consideration of security and privacy implications. This document outlines security practices, privacy considerations, and vulnerability reporting procedures.

## Security Considerations

### Biometric Data Processing

This system processes sensitive biometric data (facial features). Key security considerations:

#### **Data Collection**
- **Minimal Data**: Only collect biometric data necessary for the intended application
- **Consent**: Obtain explicit user consent before processing biometric data
- **Purpose Limitation**: Use biometric data only for the stated purpose
- **Transparency**: Clearly inform users about data collection and processing

#### **Data Storage**
- **Local Processing**: Face recognition processing occurs locally on the STM32N6 device
- **No Cloud Storage**: By default, biometric data is not transmitted to external servers
- **Temporary Storage**: Facial embeddings are stored temporarily in volatile memory
- **Secure Deletion**: Ensure proper deletion of biometric data when no longer needed

### Hardware Security

#### **Physical Security**
- **Device Access**: Secure physical access to the STM32N6 development board
- **Debug Interfaces**: Disable debug interfaces in production deployments
- **Tamper Detection**: Consider hardware tamper detection for high-security applications

#### **Firmware Security**
- **Secure Boot**: Implement secure boot procedures for production firmware
- **Code Signing**: Sign firmware images to prevent unauthorized modifications
- **Memory Protection**: Utilize MPU (Memory Protection Unit) features when available

## Privacy Compliance

### Regulatory Compliance

Users must ensure compliance with applicable privacy regulations:

#### **GDPR (European Union)**
- **Data Subject Rights**: Implement rights to access, rectify, and delete biometric data
- **Privacy by Design**: Implement privacy protections from system design phase
- **Data Protection Impact Assessment**: Conduct DPIA for high-risk biometric processing
- **Consent Management**: Implement proper consent mechanisms

#### **CCPA (California)**
- **Consumer Rights**: Implement rights to know, delete, and opt-out
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary biometric information
- **Security Measures**: Implement reasonable security measures

#### **BIPA (Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act)**
- **Written Consent**: Obtain written consent before biometric data collection
- **Retention Limits**: Establish and follow biometric data retention schedules
- **Destruction**: Permanently destroy biometric data when purpose is fulfilled

#### **Other Jurisdictions**
- Research and comply with local biometric and privacy laws
- Consider sector-specific regulations (healthcare, education, etc.)
- Implement appropriate cross-border data transfer protections

### Privacy Best Practices

#### **Data Minimization**
```c
// Example: Limit embedding storage
#define EMBEDDING_BANK_SIZE 10    // Limit stored embeddings
#define EMBEDDING_RETENTION_TIME 3600  // Auto-delete after 1 hour
```

#### **Anonymization**
- Consider facial template anonymization techniques
- Implement irreversible biometric template protection
- Use one-way hash functions for stored templates when possible

#### **User Control**
- Provide clear opt-in/opt-out mechanisms
- Allow users to delete their biometric data
- Implement granular privacy controls

## Vulnerability Reporting

### Security Contact

For security vulnerabilities, please contact:
- **Email**: [Create security contact email]
- **Response Time**: We aim to respond within 48 hours
- **Disclosure**: We follow responsible disclosure practices

### Reporting Guidelines

#### **What to Report**
- Authentication bypasses
- Biometric data leaks or unauthorized access
- Remote code execution vulnerabilities
- Privacy control bypasses
- Hardware security issues

#### **Report Format**
Please include:
```
Title: Brief description of the vulnerability
Severity: Critical/High/Medium/Low
Component: Affected system component
Steps to Reproduce: Detailed reproduction steps
Impact: Potential security/privacy impact
Suggested Fix: If known
```

#### **Responsible Disclosure**
- **Report First**: Report vulnerabilities privately before public disclosure
- **Coordination**: Work with maintainers on fix timeline
- **Public Disclosure**: Allow reasonable time for fixes before public disclosure
- **Credit**: Security researchers will be credited for responsible disclosure

## Security Configuration

### Recommended Security Settings

#### **Disable Debug Features in Production**
```c
// In Inc/app_config.h - Production configuration
#undef DEBUG_MODE
#undef ENABLE_ITM_TRACE
#undef ENABLE_UART_DEBUG
```

#### **Enable Security Features**
```c
// Enable memory protection
#define USE_MPU_PROTECTION
#define ENABLE_STACK_PROTECTION
#define USE_SECURE_MEMORY_REGIONS
```

#### **Minimize Attack Surface**
```c
// Disable unnecessary features
#undef ENABLE_PC_STREAM      // Disable if not needed
#undef ENABLE_UART_COMMANDS  // Disable remote commands
#define LOCAL_PROCESSING_ONLY // Force local processing
```

## Security Testing

### Recommended Security Tests

#### **Biometric Security**
- **Template Security**: Test biometric template protection
- **Spoofing Resistance**: Test against photo/video attacks
- **Privacy Leakage**: Verify no biometric data leakage

#### **Firmware Security**
```bash
# Static analysis tools
cppcheck --enable=all Src/ Inc/
flawfinder Src/ Inc/

# Memory analysis
valgrind --tool=memcheck ./test_application
```
